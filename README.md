# 📖 [Bookstore] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[Bookstore]** 
The objective of this `Bookstore` project milestone, `Styling` is to add CSS styles to the `Bookstore` project I have been doing for the last week. As this project, `Bookstore` is developed using react, react component re-renders based on the sate change from the centrally stored `Redux store`. Basically this project is a `react-redux` web application project where rendering is done using react components and the state of the application is centrally manged by the `Redux` stat-UI binding framework. Redux is used to manage the state of the application and it stores the state in one place centrally. Again `createASyncThunk` thunk function is used to implement the three functionalities of API (posting, fetching, and removing a book).
